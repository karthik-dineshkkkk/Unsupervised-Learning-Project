# Unsupervised-Learning-Project
• Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris dataset to extract informative features

• Conducted K-Means Clustering on the Iris dataset using the features extracted from PCA. Explored various values of K and evaluated the clustering performance using the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) metric.

• Implemented the K-Means algorithm manually, without relying on in-built functions, to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and identify the optimal number of clusters based on the maximum NMI value.
